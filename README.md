# ExceptionHandlingExample

A simple smart contract to demonstrate basic exception handling techniques in Ethereum smart contracts.

## Description

The ExceptionHandlingExample contract allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether while demonstrating the use of assert, require, and revert for error handling. Additionally, it includes an owner-only function to illustrate access control in smart contracts.

## Getting Started

### Installing

* Clone the repository or copy the ExceptionHandlingExample contract into your project directory.
* Ensure you have an Ethereum development environment set up, such as Hardhat or Truffle.

### Executing program

* Deploy the contract using your preferred Ethereum development environment. For example, using Hardhat:

javascript
const ExceptionHandlingExample = await ethers.getContractFactory("ExceptionHandlingExample");
const exceptionHandlingExample = await ExceptionHandlingExample.deploy();
await exceptionHandlingExample.deployed();
console.log("Contract deployed to:", exceptionHandlingExample.address);
